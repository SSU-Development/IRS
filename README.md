those who recover

sudo bash irs_builder.sh board.bin
```

Uses wifi (Yes, it works!!!) or Ethernet.

# What can it do?
* ✅ Connect to wifi
* ✅ Download recovery images
* ✅ Recover with those recovery images, or images put in the device by another device.

> [!WARNING]
> Wifi on some grunt boards is broken. One of them is, in fact, barla. Fuck you, barla. If anyone has a solution for this, please tell us in [SSU's discord server](https://discord.gg/aB8fJZw86r).<br>
